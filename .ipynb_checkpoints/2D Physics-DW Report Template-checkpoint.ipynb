    "## Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "Describe how you collect your data and the reasoning behind such approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "How data is collected:\n",
    "1. If the water is higher temperature than the room, wait for the temperature increase to 26 degrees celcius, if not wait for the water to decrease to 24 degrees celcius\n",
    "2. Every second afterward, record the temperature of the water with the sensor.\n",
    "3. Wait for 2 minutes and record the temperature of the water with the thermometer\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasoning:\n",
    "1. It is imperative that the starting temperature is always the same. Hence we write the program such that it starts at 26 degrees celcius, or 24 degrees celcius, making a constant starting point for both increasing and decreasing of temperatures\n",
    "2. By collecting the data at every second, we are able to have more data points and thus more accurately determine the final temperature\n",
    "3. Waiting 2 minutes should suffice for the thermometer to come within 0.1 degrees celcius of the actual water temperature, allowing us to know the actual temperature\n"
